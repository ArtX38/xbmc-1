Serenity  XBMC Skin

- What is Serenity ?
  Serenity  is an XBMC skin that is slated to be released once the next major release 
  of XBMC dubbed "12.0 Frodo" is in the wild.

  The goal for Serenity is foremost to be an pleasing skin to use and look at, logical in the way it's built
  and easy to use. The speed and "flow" of the skin is the top priority.
  
  Most of the settings that is configurable should not pose any questions to what they do or how it affects
  the interface with clear descriptions or preview's before commiting to the change.

- Major Features Planned
  * Built for 1080p.
  * Documented for easy modifications.
  * Vertical and Horizontal homescreens.
  * Smooth and lighweight in it's use of textures/images.
  * Highly configurable to you liking.

- Want to help out?
  Even though the planned release date is quite far of in the future, help is greatly appriciated. If you have
  good coding skills or you are a wizard with Photoshop please get in touch.
